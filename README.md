# SftpDownloader
Requiremennts

**** Should develop a backend service using .Net core 6. The Service should:

Every 1 minute service connects to sftp and checks if there are new files.
Sftp server, file paths etc. must be configurable (not in code).\Service downloads all the new files to local path.
All downloaded files (paths) should be stored in database (postgresql).
Files from sftp are never deleted, so checking if file is new or old has to be done by checking it in database taken in consideration file creation time.
Work with database should by done by Entity framework
Database should be defined by code first principle.
Service should be resilient: handle connection problems etc. and should not "die".
Code must have comments explaining what it does.
Service should have sane logging, configurable tracing (it should be clear what is happening from logs).
Service should use dependency injection.
